#Custom HTML Helper Library for ASP.NET MVC 5

##Project Introduction:
The ASP.NET MVC framework includes helper methods that provide an easy way to render HTML in a view. Working with the limited set of HTML Helpers in MVC means you have to add a lot of custom attributes. This takes more time to code and leads to potential runtime errors. If you had more flexible HTML Helpers that added HTML5 and Bootstrap CSS for you, this would speed up development and testing. In this project, I will be building a set of MVC HTML Helpers to do just this.

##Prerequisite:
* DOT NET MVC developer (at least beginner)
* Bootstrap 
* HTML and CSS

##Project Feature:
* Custom Helpers for: img tag, button, input box, check box, radio
* Simplify your MVC code
* Build MVC Helpers to do more for you
* Easily use Bootstrap and HTML 5
* Use of StringBuilder and TagBuilder classes for creating Helpers
* Extending Existing MVC HTML Helpers 

##Tools Used:
* Visual Studio 2015
* Bootstrap v3.0.0
